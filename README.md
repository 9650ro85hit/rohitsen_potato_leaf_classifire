## Overview
The Potato Leaf Classifier is a deep learning project designed to identify and classify potato leaf diseases. This model helps in detecting the following classes:

Early Blight: A common potato disease caused by the fungus Alternaria solani.<br>
Late Blight: A serious disease of potatoes and tomatoes caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans.<br>
Healthy: Leaves without any visible disease symptoms.<br>
By accurately classifying these conditions, the model aims to aid farmers and agricultural experts in taking timely action to prevent crop damage.
